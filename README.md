# makeGroceryList v1.0
### *Simplify making and managing a grocery list.*

## Description

The goals of this project are:
* to simplify the rhythms of home cooking:
  * choosing which recipes to make
  * compiling a shopping list for the chosen recipes
  * determining what ingredients you already have

Eating home-cooked meals is often healthier and cheaper than other alternatives. But it's hard enough to find time to cook, let alone plan a menu, and shop for the ingredients. makeGroceryList makes this process simple and fluid from anywhere you can access the internet. Just navigate to this website. Select which recipes you'd like to shop for, hit "submit" and you're on your way!
